# ThumBooks
ThumBooks is an eBook reader for the TinyCircuits Thumby. It can only handle plain text files, so you'll want to convert your eBooks to .txt files. Also, the default fonts on Thumby can't display certain special characters, so you may want to check your text files for special characters and replace or remove them. Place .txt files in the root directory. After opening ThumBooks, use up and down on the D-pad to select a book from the menu, and press A to open the book or B to close ThumBooks. Use left and right on the D-pad to turn pages. Press A to set a bookmark or B to close the book. Closing a book automatically sets a bookmark at the current page. Reopening the book returns to the last page bookmarked. When reading a book, use up on the D-pad to return to the beginning of the book and down to return to the last page bookmarked.
